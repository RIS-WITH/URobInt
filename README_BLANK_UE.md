# URobInt

## How to create a blank project:

If you want to start from a blank project and still use our system (not recommended) or keep your actual project and update it with our, it's possible.

You will still need to download the URobInt project to migrate few folders.

The folder VR_Template have to be migrate with the blueprint folder in experiments to your project.

You have to enable the HDRI plugins.

You might have some input issue with the blueprint to fix, either modify the blueprint with your input action or add the input action need in your project settings.

Then follow the step of the README as if you are starting from the URobInt project.
